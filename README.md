# SalesDB-ELT-StarSchema
A modern data warehouse built with SQL Server, featuring a complete ELT pipeline, dimensional data modeling, and business analytics

🚀 **Project Overview**

This project showcases a complete ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline and dimensional modeling in SQL. It demonstrates how sales data from a CSV file is ingested, validated, transformed, and structured into a star schema for business intelligence and analytics.

### Database: SalesDB

- **Schemas**:
  - `raw_data`: Staging layer for raw ingestion.
  - `analytics`: Star schema for reporting and analysis.

- **Source**: CSV file containing sales transactions.
- **Tools Used**: SQL Server (T-SQL).

## 🔄 ELT Pipeline Breakdown

### **Extract & Load**
- Raw data is imported into `raw_data.Sales_Staging`.
- Temporary import table is dropped after loading.

### **Data Validation**
- Row count validation.
- Duplicate `Order_ID` detection.
- Null checks across critical fields.

### **Transformation**
- Surrogate key (`Order_Key`) added to staging table.
- Dimension tables populated using `SELECT DISTINCT` from staging data.
- **Date Dimension** enriched with `Year` and `Month` attributes.
- Fact table populated using foreign key lookups.

## 📋 Sample Business Analysis Queries

### Key Metrics Addressed:
- **Revenue**: Total Revenue, Profit, and Profit Margin.
- **Performance**: Profit Margin and Revenue by Sub_Category.
- **Growth**: Monthly Revenue Trends and Fastest-Growing Categories.
- **Troubleshooting**: Underperforming Sub_Categories.

For example:
1. **Total Revenue, Profit, and Margin**:
   - What is the overall performance?
2. **Top Revenue-Generating Sub_Category**:
   - Which categories contribute the most?
3. **Monthly Revenue Trends**:
   - How does revenue change month-to-month?
